# CPSC-103 - Practice-Problems & Resources
Student-made practice problems for CPSC 103 @ UBC

To Do Log: 
-Adapted practice final problems intended for pen/paper assessment into organized Jupyter notebook cells 
-Added step-by-step solutions/study guides to practice problems 
-Created bonus questions to supplement/extend core practice problems 
-Provided necessary csv files to complete read function problems 
-Added helper function support for final question 
-Added study tips
-Added MindNode map for course materials + PDF
-Added Anki flash cards for basic language operators/functions

Tips for Success:

1) When trying to learn the language/expression/data/function principles, try to absorb the material within an interesting, contextualized framework. This could be done through memes ("trust the recursion") or anecdotes ("Enumeration is used when you have only a certain number of board games to play"). Trying to memorize all the material in a clinical abstract environment can be difficult. Learning data defintions, for example, using trigger words or memories can help you during a crucial moment during an example. 

For example, when trying to commit compound data definitions you could try practice using it in the context of a hypotethical situation. Imagine using a compound data defintion to a record data if you were conducting COVID-19 contact tracing. Each data point would have clearly definied and limited categories such as name, address, test results, travel history, etc. 

2) Be prepared before reaching out to your TAs and professors for help. To make the most of your time and that of your TA/professor, try to prepare and do your due diligence before asking them for help.

For example, if a particular code review is very challenging and would like some assistance. Try going through the whole code review assignment - take note of which particular questions/lines of code is causing you the most frustration - make a note of what question you would like to ask (knowing that they will not give you the direct/full answer). 

You may find that in doing this preparation that you may find the answer yourself. 

3) Keep up with the weekly assignments with efficient tools. I used Wunderlist/Google Calendar/Canvas notifications/Evernote to keep on top of all the deadlines you'll be responsible for. The Canvas mobile app is also very useful to quickly keep track of deadlines. 

4) Collaborate with peers. Some of the most interesting uses for Python and convenient workflows/keyboard shortcuts that I learned were from fellow peers. Reaching out to ask or even answering questions during the project building lectures/Piazza/project presentations/Demco sessions provides a wealth of useful tips. 

5) Be polite and respectful to TAs. They can be your greatest ally in your CPSC 103 journey.
