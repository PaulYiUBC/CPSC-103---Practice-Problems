# CPSC-103 - Practice-Problems & Resources
Student-made practice problems for CPSC 103 @ UBC

To Do Log: 

-Adapted practice final problems intended for pen/paper assessment into organized Jupyter notebook cells 

-Added step-by-step solutions/study guides to practice problems 

-Created bonus questions to supplement/extend core practice problems 

-Provided necessary csv files to complete read function problems 

-Added helper function support for final question 

-Added study tips

-Added MindNode map for course materials + PDF

-Added Anki flash cards for basic language operators/functions

Tips for Success:

1) When trying to learn the language/expression/data/function principles, try to absorb the material within an interesting, contextualized framework. This could be done through memes ("trust the recursion") or anecdotes ("Enumeration is used when you have only a certain number of board games to play"). Trying to memorize all the material in a clinical abstract environment can be difficult. Learning data definitions, for example, using trigger words or memories can help you during a crucial moment during an exam. 

For example, when trying to commit compound data definitions you could try practice using it in the context of a hypothetical  situation. Imagine using a compound data definition to record data if you were conducting COVID-19 contact tracing. Each data point would have clearly defined and limited categories such as name, address, test results, travel history, etc. 

2) Learn through practice. Avoid the temptation to immediately look at the answer key or solution file when attempting past final exams or practice problems. If you are checking the answer at the first moment of uncertainty then you are putting yourself at a disadvantage for the final exam. Instead embrace those moments of frustration and failure when attempting questions - those hours of trial/error will ensure you'll be able to commit the course material to memory and be able to effectively recall the necessary problem solving tools when facing a novel question on a future exam. 

In addition, learn from your mistakes. If you are having trouble figuring out how to study for CSPC 103 then try to look back at your past mistakes (quizzes, midterms, code-reviews, tutorials, etc). You may find a trend or pattern which can show you what are your greatest weaknesses. For example, you find that your consistently got marks off for data definition  templating. You identify that you have trouble reconciling different data templates such as when a compound data definition  cross-references an Enumeration data definition. You can then decide to practice this type of coding in an empty jupyter notebook or reference practice problems. 

3) Be prepared before reaching out to your TAs and professors for help. To make the most of your time and that of your TAs/professors, try to prepare and do your due diligence before asking them for help.

For example, if a particular code review is very challenging and you would like some assistance. Try going through the whole code review assignment - take note of which particular questions/lines of code is causing you the most frustration - make a note of what question you would like to ask (knowing that they will not give you the direct/full answer). 

You may find that in doing this preparation that you may find the answer yourself. 

4) Keep up with the weekly assignments with efficient tools. Use Microsoft To Do, Google Calendar, Canvas notifications, Evernote, etc to keep on top of all the deadlines you'll be responsible for. The Canvas mobile app is also very useful to quickly keep track of deadlines. 

5) Collaborate with peers. Some of the most interesting uses for Python and convenient workflows/keyboard shortcuts that I learned were from fellow peers. Reaching out to ask or even answering questions during the project building lectures/Piazza/project presentations/Demco sessions provides a wealth of useful tips. 

6) Be polite and respectful to TAs. They can be your greatest ally in your CPSC 103 journey. Rather than demanding from them the direct path in answering a question, try asking them for guideposts or analogous sub-problems to help you where you want to go.
