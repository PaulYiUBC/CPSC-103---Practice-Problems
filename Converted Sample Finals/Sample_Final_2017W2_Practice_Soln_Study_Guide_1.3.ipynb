    "#The goal of the user-defined data is to track expenses. It states that the table given is only a few rows of a larger sample. \n",
    "#It is unknown how many expenses there are but since there is no upper limit given, you can assume there might be many more. \n",
    "#At this point, you should recognize that you will likely need to design an Expense data defintion and a List of Expenses data defintion. \n",
    "\n",
    "#An Expense data defintion has four clear attributes: name, category, payment, amount. \n",
    "#This should indicate to you that a compound data defintion is needed to store these defined information fields. \n",

    "#The Category field is stated to be non-distinct - there are many different categories and new ones will likley be created in the future. \n",
    "#On the other hand, Payment will only have four distinct values: cash, credit, cheque, or debit ===> this should indicate to you that an Enum data defintion will be required.\n",
